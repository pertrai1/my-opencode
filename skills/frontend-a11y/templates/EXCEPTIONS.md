# A11y Exceptions Log (Template)

This document logs known deviations from accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2 AA / EN 301 549) that have been temporarily accepted.

> **Objective:** Provide technical and legal transparency by documenting *where*, *why*, and *how* we temporarily mitigate guidelines that could not be met due to technical, platform, or scope limitations.

> **Rules:**
> 1. An exception is **temporary** and does not change the requirement.
> 2. Every exception MUST have a **risk owner**, an **approver**, a **tracking issue**, and an **expiry date** — "dependent on third-party" still gets a review date.
> 3. Scope is the **narrowest practical**: one component/selector, never a whole rule.
> 4. At expiry, the exception is reviewed: fixed and removed, or consciously renewed with a new date. **Never silently suppressed.**
> 5. **AI duty:** in review mode, the AI MUST flag any exception past its expiry date as 🟠 HIGH technical debt.
> 6. This log is a **versioned project record** — never add it to `.gitignore`. Exceptions must be visible in pull requests and auditable later; a risk record hidden from version control protects no one.

## 🛑 Exception Log

### 1. Basic Details
- **Exception ID:** [e.g., EXT-2026-001]
- **Component / Page:** [e.g., Financial Dashboard Dynamic Table]
- **WCAG Guideline Affected:** [e.g., 2.1.1 Keyboard (A) and 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)]
- **Severity (User Impact):** [🔴 Critical | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🔵 Low]
- **Risk Owner:** [Who is accountable for this deviation — a person, not a team]
- **Approved by:** [Who signed off on accepting the risk — lead/PO/QA]
- **Tracking Issue:** [Link to the backlog item where this debt is chased]

### 2. Technical Blockade Description
- **What is broken?** [Explain in detail what the user cannot do].
- **Why did it happen?** [State the limitation: Unsupported third-party tool, legacy UI architecture impossible to refactor in the current cycle, etc.].

### 3. Workaround (Fallback / Remediation)
- **How can the user still complete the task?** [Accessibility is a precondition. If the chart is not keyboard accessible, is there a text table narrating the results? Is there an option via support?]

### 4. Resolution Plan and Expiry
- **Expiry (review-by date):** [YYYY-MM-DD — mandatory. On this date the exception is fixed, or consciously renewed with a new date]
- **Resolution Criterion:** [What needs to happen for this exception to no longer exist?]
