# Toasts & Notifications Guide

> **Scope:** Toasts, snackbars, banners, status messages.

## 0. The rule everything else follows

**A toast the user cannot perceive, reach, or outlive is a message that was never sent.** Toasts fail in three independent ways — not announced (invisible to screen readers), announced but unreachable (an action inside vanishes before a keyboard user arrives), and gone too fast to read. A toast must survive all three, or carry nothing that matters.

1. **`role="status"` is the default; `role="alert"` is the exception** — reserved for errors needing immediate attention. Never both together, and never `aria-live` stacked on either (the *redundant-alert* the tooling flags). The live region **exists in the DOM before** the first message enters it; inject text into a standing region, don't inject the region.
2. **Never move focus to a toast.** It hijacks typing and screen-reader context for something that calls itself passive. If a response truly requires action *now*, that is a dialog (see [Modals](guide-modals.md)), not a toast.
3. **Auto-dismiss is for the inert only.** A toast carrying an **action or link MUST persist** until dismissed — a timed action is a time limit (SC 2.2.1) that zoomed-in, screen-reader and slow-reacting users all lose. Purely informational toasts that do auto-dismiss stay long enough to be read (a baseline of ~6 seconds, scaled up with message length).
4. **The action must also live somewhere permanent.** "Undo" that exists only in a 5-second toast is a feature with an expiry date; the same operation belongs in the item's menu or history. The toast is a convenience shortcut, not the feature's address.
5. **Dismissible by keyboard:** a real close `<button>` with a name, reachable by `Tab` — and `Esc` dismisses the focused toast.
6. **Same channel, same place:** toasts appear in a consistent position across the product; repeats collapse (*"3 items archived"*) instead of stacking a tower the reader announces one by one.
