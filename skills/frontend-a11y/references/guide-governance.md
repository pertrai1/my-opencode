# A11y Governance & Compliance Strategy

> Scope: Static verification, VPAT strategy, ADA/EAA compliance, EN 301 549, and external audit readiness.

## 1. Static Verification (The Engineering Minimum)
Primary verification does not consist of dictating rigid rules in a *specific pipeline*, but holding the development environment (Be it the Dev or the AI running in real-time) accountable for fast static validation tests.
- **Code Standard:** The code *must* necessarily pass through linters or accessibility-focused evaluators (like `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` or the `axe` engine) without displaying critical/serious violations before code consolidation.
- **This standard's own tools:** the repository ships two optional, dependency-free scripts in [`tools/`](https://github.com/fecarrico/A11Y.md/tree/main/tools): `verify-a11y.py` runs against **your project** — checking that the artifacts exist, that `REPORT.md` is newer than the last interface change, and that the source is free of the Section 6 anti-patterns; `lint-standard.py` runs against **copies or forks of this standard**, checking language parity, loading triggers and links. Running them is never a requirement of the standard — `A11Y.md` is portable markdown — but a gate that fails a build is stronger than a rule someone has to remember.
- **Decoupling:** Do not try to "write robust logic for accessible components and try to fix them": adopt agnostic libraries (Headless UI) whenever native HTML semantics do not cover the feature requirements.

### 1.1. Default configuration is not coverage

A clean axe run means "no violation among the rules that were enabled". Two defaults are worth correcting:

- **Enable the experimental rules that carry a Success Criterion.** `label-content-name-mismatch` detects an accessible name that does not contain the visible text — an **SC 2.5.3 Level AA failure** that breaks voice control — and it ships **disabled by default**, in axe-core and in the browser extension alike. Turn it on: `axe.run(context, { rules: { 'label-content-name-mismatch': { enabled: true } } })`, or check *Experimental rules* in the extension's settings.
- **Resolve the linter × engine conflict instead of silencing it.** `scrollable-region-focusable` (axe) requires a focus stop on a container the user can scroll but not tab into; `no-noninteractive-tabindex` (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`) flags that exact `tabIndex`. Following both literally is impossible, and the path of least resistance — disabling the ESLint rule — removes a real guard. Configure it instead:
  ```jsonc
  // .eslintrc — allow the focus stop axe requires, keep the rule everywhere else
  "jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-tabindex": ["error", { "roles": ["region"], "tags": [], "allowExpressionValues": true }]
  ```
  And remember the axe rule is **conditional**: the focus stop belongs only on regions whose content actually overflows. Applying it to every scroll container adds tab stops that lead nowhere (see *Focus Traps Nobody Asked For*, `A11Y.md` §6).

> **A CI gate is a form of independent verification.** *Independent Verification* (`A11Y.md` §2) asks that the evidence not be authored solely by the agent that wrote the code. A pipeline check satisfies that for the mechanical layer by construction — it runs outside the session, against the artifact, with no memory of the decisions that produced it. It does not, however, satisfy the human checkpoints, and it does not raise the report's declared independence level for anything a machine cannot test.

### 1.2. Independent Verification — who signs the evidence

*Independent Verification* (`A11Y.md` §2) exists because self-review re-runs the reasoning that produced the defect. The evidence: this standard's own Orphaned ARIA defect survived the generating agent, axe **and** Lighthouse, surfacing only in an independent test ([a11y-md-ai-test](https://github.com/mjepis7/a11y-md-ai-test), by Maria Eduarda Iwashita); and models find more bugs in another model's code than in their own (Greptile, [*Models are worse at reviewing their own code*](https://www.greptile.com/blog/model-inversion), 2026 — two 500-PR datasets, the pattern inverts both ways).

- **cross-agent** — a different model breaks the correlation between the defects generated and the defects looked for. The strongest form.
- **fresh-context** — the same model *without the conversation that produced the code*: removes the memory of having decided. The floor everywhere — it costs a new chat over the same project, never a new tool.
- **self-reported** ⚠️ — honest and visible, never sufficient: it re-runs the exact failure mode the rule exists to break. Ceiling: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL.

The declaration is trust-based and still auditable: `REPORT.md` names *who* verified, and `verify-a11y.py` enforces the ceiling mechanically (a self-reported ✅ PASS fails the gate). None of it replaces the human checkpoints — a second agent can resolve a reference between files; it cannot hear a screen reader.

## 2. Descriptive Evidence (The "Why")
When creating custom complex widgets, the developer (or AI) must include a comment block explaining the accessibility strategy:
- What is the focus order?
- How are states communicated?
- What is the fallback for non-JS environments?

## 3. Visual Language Constraints
- **Color:** Never communicate state (Valid/Invalid/Warning) using only color. An accompanying icon or text description is mandatory.
- **Contrast:** Brand colors that fail 4.5:1 ratio must be adjusted for UI elements or paired with a high-contrast alternative.

## 4. Audits and Legal Compliance (ADA/EAA Readiness)
To prepare subsystems for external certification and audit:
1. **Inventory:** Consolidate a list or storybook of the key visual components of the flow and their behaviors with assistive technologies.
2. **Keyboard Path:** Prevent Dead-ends through clear and planned mapping of the visual layout order (`Tab`).
3. **Standard Audit:** The checklist in [**`templates/REPORT.md`**](../templates/REPORT.md) **MUST** be operated as "Definition of Done" **before any delivery to an end user** — a published build, a deploy, a shared artifact, a tag — not only at a "final delivery" that continuously delivered projects never reach (see *Release Evidence*, `A11Y.md` §2).
4. **One living report, not one per publish:** the report tracks the **interface**, not the release count. If nothing changed since the last one, it stands as is. When the interface changes, update the date and revisit only the entries that change affects: any checkpoint whose evidence the change invalidates goes back to `[ ]` or `[~]` until re-verified. Human checkpoints (screen reader, color simulator) keep their `[x]` and the date of the session that produced them, and are re-run when the flow they covered changes.

## 4.1. Formal evaluation (WCAG-EM) — when the project will be audited

Not every product goes through an external audit, and this standard does not assume it will. But **when it does**, `REPORT.md` alone is not the right instrument: it tracks a *feature*, while an audit evaluates an *entire site or application*. The two are complementary, and the gap between them shows up late — usually when the Accessibility Declaration required by Section 6 has to be issued.

Where a formal audit, third-party evaluation or public declaration is on the horizon, anchor the work in the W3C's official methodology, [WCAG-EM](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/):

1. **Define the scope:** which URLs/screens, which target level, which accessibility-supported technologies.
2. **Explore:** identify page types, essential functionality, technologies in use.
3. **Select the sample:** structured pages (one of each type, plus complete flows) plus a randomly selected sample — auditing "the main pages" without a declared sampling method is not an evaluation, it is an opinion.
4. **Audit the sample** against every criterion at the target level.
5. **Report:** use the W3C-WAI [Evaluation Report Template](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/report-template/) or the [WCAG-EM Report Tool](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool), which produce the format auditors and regulators expect to read.

The project's accumulated `REPORT.md` files are the **provenance evidence** for that audit: they show what was verified, when, by whom, and what stayed open. A repository with a history of reports arrives at formal evaluation with ballast; one without starts from zero.

## 5. Reporting & Liability (VPAT Strategy)
Projects targeting the US market must be Section 508 compliant:
- **VPAT Creation:** Maintain a technical document that records which WCAG criteria are fully or partially supported.
- **Traceability:** Each major feature must have a comment in the code citing which WCAG criterion is being respected.

## 6. European Compliance (EN 301 549)
For EAA compliance:
- **Interoperability:** Ensure the software does not prevent the use of third-party assistive technologies.
- **Accessibility Declaration:** Maintain a public accessibility page describing the features and the achieved compliance level.

## 6.1. Brazilian Compliance (ABNT NBR 17225 / LBI)

For products serving a Brazilian audience:

- **ABNT NBR 17225:2025** — *Accessibility in web content and applications: requirements* (March 2025) — is the Brazilian technical standard and the ballast for **article 63 of the LBI (Lei 13.146/2015)**, which mandates accessibility for the sites of public bodies and of companies with presence in Brazil. It organizes **146 items — 96 requirements + 50 recommendations — in 16 thematic groups**, each mapped to a WCAG 2.2 SC, and defines two conformance levels:
  - **Regular** = all 96 requirements — declared equivalent to WCAG 2.2 A+AA. Profile mapping: **Standard (AA) ≈ regular**.
  - **Plena** = requirements + all 50 recommendations, where an unmet recommendation demands a *reasonable justification* — the exact mechanics of this standard's `EXCEPTIONS.md` / `A11Y-DECISIONS.md`. Profile mapping: **Shield (AAA) ≈ plena**.
- **Annex A — the critical-items list**, the acceptance checklist in Brazilian public procurement: CAPTCHA with an alternative modality · **facial recognition / biometrics with an accessible alternative route** · content only on hover/focus · content inserted via CSS · third-party content, with the user warned · custom components · **downloadable (non-HTML) files that are themselves accessible** · layout tables · markup per specification. Three of these go beyond day-to-day WCAG practice: biometrics, files, and CSS-injected content.
- **Annex B** carries ten functional-performance statements (from EN 301 549) — `REPORT.md` §7 offers them as an optional section serving NBR, EN 301 549 and VPAT at once.
- **Official validators:** the formal diagnosis for the São Paulo digital-accessibility seal — and the federal guidance — converge on three engines: **AMAWeb**, **AccessMonitor** and **WAVE**. A clean axe run covers most of what they measure, but a Brazilian destination runs the three before any formal claim (the seal requires their diagnosis dated within 10 days).
- **Practical effect:** with a Brazilian destination, `REPORT.md` declares the NBR level targeted (regular/plena) alongside the compliance profile, and Annex A is treated as a named checklist. For sign-language users, see [Sign Language & Libras](guide-sign-language-br.md).

## 7. Compliance Versioning
Current focused standard: **WCAG 2.2 AA** | **EN 301 549** | **ABNT NBR 17225** (Brazil, where applicable).
Deviations from legal requirements due to severe UI/UX, native platform, or base architecture limitations, **MUST** be justified mandatorily using the matrix file on the page: [**`templates/EXCEPTIONS.md`**](../templates/EXCEPTIONS.md). All these points must have compensatory actions.
